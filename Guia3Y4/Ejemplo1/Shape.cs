/* The code snippet is defining an abstract class named `Shape` in C#. This abstract class contains an
abstract method `ShapeArea()` which must be implemented by any class that inherits from the `Shape`
class. The `ShapeArea()` method is declared as abstract, meaning it does not have an implementation
in the `Shape` class itself but must be implemented by any derived class. This allows for
polymorphism and enables different shapes to calculate their areas in a specific way based on their
individual implementations. */
