defined in the `IAreaCalculator` interface. In this case, the `Rectangle` class has properties
`Slide1` and `Slide2` representing the sides of a rectangle, a property `Area` to store the
calculated area, and a method `AreaCalculate()` to calculate the area of the rectangle based on the
provided sides. */
